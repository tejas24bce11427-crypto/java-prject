##  **Project Description**

The **Student Performance Analytics System** is a GUI-based software built using **Java Swing**.
It allows users to:

* Add and manage student records
* Record subject-wise marks
* Automatically calculate averages, percentages, and grades
* Generate detailed analytics and insights
* Produce individual student performance reports
* Store data persistently using serialization

This project is ideal for **academic submissions, student record management systems, and GUI-based Java learning**.
